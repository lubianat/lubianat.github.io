            <p>Recently I had the opportunity to attend Biocuration 2024, in Faridabad, India, thanks to a travel
                fellowship awarded by the International Society for Biocuration. It was one of the best conferences I
                ever attended: great talks, great tea breaks, great venue, great city.</p>

            <p>I am truly impressed by India's pace in the biodata realm. Brazilian scientists should start turning
                their gaze a bit more towards India; we share so many challenges, and there is a lot we could learn from
                each other. I am also impressed by India in all other realms: the food, the people, the architecture,
                the biodiversity, everything!</p>

            <p>I am also very happy to see the Society for Biocuration increasing its global connections. Most data- and
                knowledge-bases in life sciences are in the US-Europe corner; I see the space for way more protagonism
                from LATAM, Africa, and Asia in general. The biocuration community cares a lot about its people, and it
                is great to see this network of data, knowledge, and people care ever expanding.</p>

            <p>Biocuration 2024 was probably the last conference before I get my PhD later in the year (hopefully!), so
                it was even more important to me. Great to see so many friends and colleagues face to face (like Pascale
                Gaudet, Mary Ann Tuli, Frederic Bastian, Charles Tapley Hoyt, Claudia Sánchez-Beato Johnson, M.S, Sumir
                Pandit, and so many others!). See you around somewhere in the world—perhaps when Biocuration comes back
                to India and I have an excuse to go there again. :)</p>

            <p>Ah, here are my slides, talking about OBO Foundry and Wikidata:</p>
