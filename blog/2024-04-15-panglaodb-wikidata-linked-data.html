            <p>Fresh pre-print out by Jo√£o Vitor Cavalcante and me reporting on a small side-ish project from back in
                2020! We finally got to arrange the write-up and get it out on bioRxiv.</p>

            <p>It was a fun, straightforward project of transforming cell type markers on PanglaoDB into semantic
                knowledge on Wikidata. Once the information is there, we could run some SPARQL queries to navigate the
                connected pieces. In the paper, we detailed the integration process and highlighted a few possible
                SPARQL queries and their results.</p>

            <p>Some notes on two figures from the paper:
            <ul>
                <li>There is a disease-drug-gene-cell network, showing the multi-hops enabled by Wikidata.</li>
                <li>There is also a small methods diagram showing the steps involved in getting data out there.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>It is a rather niche work, but if you like biomedical knowledge graphs, heterogeneous networks, Wikidata,
                or management of cell-type information, it could be a good read.</p>

            <p>Oh, and BioRxiv has partnered up with ScienceCast and is generating audio abstracts for the pre-prints! I
                was positively surprised by the quality of the generation. Nice to see one more cool tech for open
                science communication.</p>
