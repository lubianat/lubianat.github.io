            <p>As academics, we often find resources available only in English. While a common language is essential,
                our mother tongues are equally important, and it's empowering when platforms consider them. Notably,
                ontologies used for biomedical data annotation, like Gene Ontology, Disease Ontology, and UBERON anatomy
                ontology, are typically English-only. But what if we need standard labels in Portuguese, German, or
                Italian?</p>

            <p>Wikidata supports over 200 languages for scientific concepts, evolving through community feedback and
                promoting epistemic justice. While resources like The Monarch Initiative's Human Phenotype Ontology are
                making great advances in internationalization (<a href="https://lnkd.in/dR4T6wUM"
                    target="_blank">link</a>), Wikidata presents an alternative, continuous community-driven system for
                other ontologies. By embracing Wikidata’s multilingual capabilities, we can democratize access to
                scientific knowledge.</p>

            <p>It is particularly useful for the Human Cell Atlas (HCA) community, which already values so much human
                diversity. Wikidata’s multilingual capability offers a solution to internationalize its English-centric
                products, helping globalize cell biology advancements and promoting language diversity.</p>

            <p>As the Cell Ontology is the de facto common registry for cell types, I’ve been exploring over the past
                four years how Wikidata can be harnessed for its advance. Yesterday I finally got to finish a
                multilingual prototype for the Cell Ontology, including cell type names in several languages. Check it
                out here: <a href="https://tiago.bio.br/multilang_cl/" target="_blank">Multilingual Cell Ontology
                    Prototype</a>.</p>

            <p>If Wikidata’s potential for multilinguality interests you, I'd be delighted to assist! Explore the
                prototype, share your thoughts, and join the ongoing discussion about integrating multilingual layers
                into scientific resources.</p>
