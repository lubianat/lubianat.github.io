            <p>For the first time in 27 years, I am not a student! This Monday I defended my PhD thesis on Wikidata and
                its role in bioinformatics, with a focus on cell types and the Human Cell Atlas, finalizing my formal
                education path.</p>

            <p>I am very grateful for the opportunity, and I thank Helder Nakaya and FAPESP for the support and the
                committee members (Yesid Cuesta Astroz, Helena Brentani, and Jose Eduardo Santarem Segundo) for the
                evaluation and considerations. I thank especially my family, complete outsiders to the academic bubble,
                but that always believed in the power of education. Now let's see if I can get a job!</p>

            <p>Jokes aside, it has been immensely fun, and the Universidade de São Paulo has become a true alma mater
                for me. I am eager to see the directions that life will take me :). </p>

            <p>As a spoiler, it will likely involve some philosophical work with Prof. João Cortese, investigating the
                roots of our notions of "cell type", and how ontologies/Wikibase can be leveraged for that. I am waiting
                for a response from FAPESP on the scholarship (it has been +100 days already) to figure out when and
                how.</p>

            <p>The recording of the defense (in Portuguese) is available below:</p>
