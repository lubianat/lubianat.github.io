            <p>I am starting a new role as a <strong>Wikimedian-in-Residence</strong> for the Biodiversity Heritage
                Library, supported by the Smithsonian Libraries and Archives (SLA)!</p>
            <p>For the next 6 months, I will assist the BHL-Wiki partnership in connecting their outstanding corpus to
                the Wikimedia Foundation ecosystem. The focus will be on the 300,000+ beautiful images of classic
                biodiversity works and improving their metadata quality via a data model including Structured Data on
                Wikimedia Commons and linked data on Wikidata.</p>
            <p>I am very excited about this role. It is a dream job, combining the data skills I acquired during my PhD
                with a lifelong passion for biodiversity! If you are curious about the work I am doing, about BHL,
                and/or Wikipedia, please reach out!</p>
            <p>A part of this job is connecting with people around the globe (especially in Africa and South America) to
                make this corpus actionable for the eco/biodiv challenges in the Global South â€“ so I am eager to
                collaborate, assist, and learn from anyone interested in this angle ðŸŒ±</p>
            <p>Oh, and I am super lucky to work with an amazing team, with an outstanding track record of contributions
                to biodiversity and open knowledge, including (but not limited to) the leadership on the BHL-Wiki
                working group, namely JJ Dearborn, Giovanna Fontenelle, Jake Orlowitz, and Siobhan Leachman! Thank you
                for trusting me for this task â€“ I am eager to see what we will be able to achieve!</p>
            <p>JJ also set up a fantastic blog post that explains a bit of this endeavor:<br>
