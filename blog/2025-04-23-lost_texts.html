            <p>I have many lost blog-like texts around the web. Now I am trying to recover them.</p>

            <p>I have written stuff <a href="https://tiagolubiana.medium.com/" target="_blank">on Medium (mostly in
                    pt-br)</a>.</p>

            <p>I have written stuff <a href="https://pointstodots.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">on a blog called
                    "Points to Dots"</a>.</p>

            <p>I have written stuff <a
                    href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usu%C3%A1rio:TiagoLubiana/Wikip%C3%A9dia_e_Ci%C3%AAncia"
                    target="_blank">around Wikimedia pages (pt-br)</a>.
            </p>

            <p>I have posted <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/journal/tiagolubiana" target="_blank">one little
                    journal post on iNaturalist (pt-br)</a>.</p>

            <p>I have written <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tiago-lubiana-178a3784/" target="_blank">stuff on
                    LinkedIn too</a>
            </p>

            <p>I have written &gt;1000 Wikipedia articles in the Portuguese Wikipedia, but that maybe doesn't
                count.
            </p>

            <p>I have written<a href="https://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/95/95131/tde-24102024-173719/pt-br.php"
                    target="_blank"> a PhD thesis</a>, what is basically a long blog post.
            </p>

            <p>I've had many posts on Facebook and Twitter, but I burned them on a little warm firepit. They may
                be found only in the guts of LLMs.</p>

            <p>I live in a somewhat chaotic state of impermanence. I try and do too much stuff at the same time,
                and hosting a proper blog, well, I haven't been able to do it.</p>

            <p>I am not tech-savvy enough for a super blog, nor quite willing to pay to corps and get vendor
                lock-in for hosting images and text.</p>

            <p>Other than that, topics change, communities change. Exploration exploration exploration.</p>

            <p>I write mostly about knowledge graphs and the Wikimedia ecosystem, but sometimes I go into the
                biomedical
                side of
                things, or the ontology side of things, or the meta-science side of things, or the biodiversity
                side of
                things (which
                happens to be what I really like to think about).</p>

            <p>Bursts of writing. Streams of consciousness. Niche tutorials.</p>

            <p>Sometimes in English, that is my working language.<br>
                Sometimes in Portuguese, a language I miss so much.</p>

            <p>English has taken over my thoughts and my web presence and my writing hands</p>

            <p>I've written prose and poems in Portuguese, like <a
                    href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/pyfqqkdnjpcq#87ecbe" target="_blank">a 48-page travel diary to
                    Colombia</a>. It is not bad, but
                not quite a book.
            </p>

            <p>My current attempt is a simple HTML blog, a simple structure. It is old-fashioned, I could say.
                It is the
                internet
                before it died. A person on a keyboard talking to the world wide web at <a
                    href="https://tiago.bio.br/blog" target="_blank">https://tiago.bio.br/blog</a>.</p>

            <p>No ads, no algorithms. Just me, and GitHub Copilot putting unwanted words for tab-completing.</p>

            <p>And the freebies of GitHub Pages.</p>
